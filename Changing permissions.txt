Changing permissions

To change file and directory permissions, use the command 'chmod' (change mode). There are two basic ways of using chmod to change permissions : the symbolic method and the absolute form.


Symbolic method

 u (user)               + (add access)                  r (read)
 g (group)              - (remove access)               w (write)
 o (other)              - (set exact access)            x (execute)
 a (all)

Absolute form
